HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document.<br>
 A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset.<br>
 The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.
<br>
Disadvantages of Frames<br>
There are few drawbacks with using frames, so it's never recommended to use frames in your webpages −<br>

Some smaller devices cannot cope with frames often because their screen is not big enough to be divided up.<br>

Sometimes your page will be displayed differently on different computers due to different screen resolution.<br>
<br>
The browser's back button might not work as the user hopes.<br>

There are still few browsers that do not support frame technology.<br>
Creating Frames
To use frames on a page we use &lt;frameset&gt; tag instead of &lt;body&gt; tag. <br>
The &lt;frameset&gt; tag defines, how to divide the window into frames. <br>
The rows attribute of &lt;frameset&gt; tag defines horizontal frames and cols attribute defines vertical frames. <br>
Each frame is indicated by &lt;frame&gt; tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the frame.<br>

Note − The &lt;frame&gt; tag deprecated in HTML5. Do not use this element.<br>

Example<br>
Following is the example to create three horizontal frames <br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
<br>
   &lt;head&gt;<br>
      &lt;title&gt;HTML Frames&lt;/title&gt;<br>
   &lt;/head&gt;
	<br>
   &lt;frameset rows = "10%,80%,10%"&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame name = "top" src = "/html/top_frame.htm" /&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame name = "main" src = "/html/main_frame.htm" /&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame name = "bottom" src = "/html/bottom_frame.htm" /&gt;<br>
   
      &lt;noframes&gt;<br>
         &lt;body&gt;Your browser does not support frames.&lt;/body&gt;<br>
      &lt;/noframes&gt;<br>
      
   &lt;/frameset&gt;<br>
   
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
This will produce the following result −<br>


Example<br>
Let's put the above example as follows, here we replaced rows attribute by cols and changed their width.<br> This will create all the three frames vertically −
<br>
Live Demo<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;
   <br>
   &lt;head&gt;<br>
      &lt;title&gt;HTML Frames&lt;/title&gt;<br>
   &lt;/head&gt;<br>
   
   &lt;frameset cols = "25%,50%,25%"&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame name = "left" src = "/html/top_frame.htm" /&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame name = "center" src = "/html/main_frame.htm" /&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame name = "right" src = "/html/bottom_frame.htm" /&gt;<br>
      
      &lt;noframes&gt;<br>
         &lt;body&gt;Your browser does not support frames.&lt;/body&gt;<br>
      &lt;/noframes&gt;<br>
   &lt;/frameset&gt;<br>
   
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
This will produce the following result −<br>

<br>
The &lt;frameset&gt; Tag Attributes<br>
Following are important attributes of the &lt;frameset&gt; tag −<br>

cols<br>
Specifies how many columns are contained in the frameset and the size of each column. 
<br>
You can specify the width of each column in one of the four ways −<br>

Absolute values in pixels. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "100, 500, 100".
<br>
A percentage of the browser window. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "10%, 80%, 10%".
<br>
Using a wildcard symbol. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "10%, *, 10%". In this case wildcard takes remainder of the window.
<br>
As relative widths of the browser window. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "3*, 2*, 1*". This is an alternative to percentages. You can use relative widths of the browser window. Here the window is divided into sixths: the first column takes up half of the window, the second takes one third, and the third takes one sixth.
<br>
rows<br>

This attribute works just like the cols attribute and takes the same values, but it is used to specify the rows in the frameset.<br>
 For example, to create two horizontal frames, use rows = "10%, 90%". <br>You can specify the height of each row in the same way as explained above for columns.

<br>
border
<br>
This attribute specifies the width of the border of each frame in pixels. For example, border = "5". A value of zero means no border.
<br>

frameborder
<br>
This attribute specifies whether a three-dimensional border should be displayed between frames.<br>
 This attribute takes value either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).<br> For example frameborder = "0" specifies no border.

<br>
framespacing
<br>
This attribute specifies the amount of space between frames in a frameset.<br>
 This can take any integer value.<br>
 For example framespacing = "10" means there should be 10 pixels spacing between each frames.
<br>
The &lt;frame&gt; Tag Attributes
Following are the important attributes of &lt;frame&gt; tag −
<br>

src
<br>
This attribute is used to give the file name that should be loaded in the frame.<br>
 Its value can be any URL. For example, src = "/html/top_frame.htm" will load an HTML file available in html directory.

<br>
name
<br>
This attribute allows you to give a name to a frame. It is used to indicate which frame a document should be loaded into. <br>
This is especially important when you want to create links in one frame that load pages into an another frame, <br>
in which case the second frame needs a name to identify itself as the target of the link.

<br>
frameborder
<br>
This attribute specifies whether or not the borders of that frame are shown; 
it overrides the value given in the frameborder attribute on the &lt;frameset&gt; tag if one is given,<br>
 and this can take values either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
<br>
marginwidth
<br>
This attribute allows you to specify the width of the space between the left and right of the frame's borders and the frame's content. <br>
The value is given in pixels. For example marginwidth = "10".
<br>

marginheight
<br>
This attribute allows you to specify the height of the space between the top and bottom of the frame's borders and its contents.<br>
 The value is given in pixels. For example marginheight = "10".

<br>
noresize
<br>
By default, you can resize any frame by clicking and dragging on the borders of a frame.<br>
 The noresize attribute prevents a user from being able to resize the frame. <br>
 For example noresize = "noresize".
<br>

scrolling
<br>
This attribute controls the appearance of the scrollbars that appear on the frame.<br>
 This takes values either "yes", "no" or "auto". <br>
For example scrolling = "no" means it should not have scroll bars.

<br>
longdesc
<br>
This attribute allows you to provide a link to another page containing a long description of the contents of the frame.<br>
 For example longdesc = "framedescription.htm"
<br>
Browser Support for Frames<br>
If a user is using any old browser or any browser, <br>which does not support frames then &lt;noframes&gt; element should be displayed to the user.
<br>
So you must place a &lt;body&gt; element inside the &lt;noframes&gt; element<br> because the &lt;frameset&gt; element is supposed to replace the &lt;body&gt; element, but if a browser does not understand &lt;frameset&gt; element then it should understand what is inside the &lt;body&gt; element which is contained in a &lt;noframes&gt; element.
<br>
You can put some nice message for your user having old browsers.<br> For example, Sorry!! your browser does not support frames. as shown in the above example.
<br>
Frame's name and target attributes<br>
One of the most popular uses of frames is to place navigatio<br>n bars in one frame and then load main pages into a separate frame.
<br>
Let's see following example where a test.htm file has following code −
<br>
Live Demo<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;
<br>
   &lt;head&gt;<br>
      &lt;title&gt;HTML Target Frames&lt;/title&gt;<br>
   &lt;/head&gt;<br>
	
   &lt;frameset cols = "200, *"&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame src = "/html/menu.htm" name = "menu_page" /&gt;<br>
      &lt;frame src = "/html/main.htm" name = "main_page" /&gt;<br>
      
      &lt;noframes&gt;<br>
         &lt;body&gt;Your browser does not support frames.&lt;/body&gt;<br>
      &lt;/noframes&gt;<br>
   &lt;/frameset&gt;<br>
	
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
Here, we have created two columns to fill with two frames.<br>
 The first frame is 200 pixels wide and will contain the navigation menu bar implemented by menu.htm file
 <br> The second column fills in remaining space and will contain the main part of the page and it is implemented by main.htm file. 
 <br>
 For all the three links available in menu bar, we have mentioned target frame as main_page, <br>
 so whenever you click any of the links in menu bar, available link will open in main page.
<br>
Following is the content of menu.htm file<br>

Live Demo<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>

   &lt;body bgcolor = "#4a7d49"&gt;<br>
      &lt;a href = "http://www.google.com" target = "main_page"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;<br>
      &lt;br /&gt;<br>
      &lt;br /&gt;<br>
      
      &lt;a href = "http://www.microsoft.com" target = "main_page"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;<br>
      &lt;br /&gt;<br>
      &lt;br /&gt;<br>
      
      &lt;a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk" target = "main_page"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;<br>
   &lt;/body&gt;
	<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
Following is the content of main.htm file −<br>
<br>
Live Demo<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>

   &lt;body bgcolor = "#b5dcb3"&gt;<br>
      &lt;h3&gt;This is main page and content from any link will be displayed here.&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
      &lt;p&gt;So now click any link and see the result.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
   &lt;/body&gt;<br>
	
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
When we load test.htm file, it produces following result −
<br>

Now you can try to click links available in the left panel and see the result. The targetattribute can also take one of the following values −
<br>
Sr.No	Option & Description<br>
1	
_self

Loads the page into the current frame.<br>

2	
_blank

Loads a page into a new browser window. Opening a new window.<br>

3	
_parent

Loads the page into the parent window, which in the case of a single frameset is the main browser window.<br>

4	
_top

Loads the page into the browser window, replacing any current frames.<br>

5	
targetframe
<br>
Loads the page into a named targetframe.<br>
